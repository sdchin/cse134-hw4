# HW4 Site Changes

## Site Improvements

I replaced all placeholder text, including my biography, greeting, testimonials, and WIP descriptions. I added optimized images and jpg fallbacks (one size only) for the testimonial section and WIP page. I removed the banner from my projects page.

## Third-Party Scripts

I added Google Analytics to my website. To do this, I set up my Google Analytics account and added Google tags to all (well most, I excluded the HW4 pages) of the pages of my website. The reason I chose Google Analytics is because I wanted some way to track who visits my website. I thought it would be useful to know information like devices and browsers used, average engagement time, the number of new users visiting my website for the first time, etc. Google Analytics can keep track of this data and compile them into reports for me.

Note to self: Brave Shields is why Google Analytics wasn't working when I was testing it.
